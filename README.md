Characterization of preferential locking of bursts (rather than nonbursts) to LFP
============================================================

Cell type specific characterization of the relationship between bursts and the local field potential. This code is made freely available. If you do use it, or modify it, please cite the orginal publication :)

Package contents
============================================================

To generate figures and results from the paper, run the script:

**Voloh_Womelsdorf_CC_2017_burstWithThetaBeta.m**

This code depends on two tooboxes:
1) the fieldtrip toolbox. Download it here:
**http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/download**
2) My **matlab_functions** repo

The included code:
1) Calculates the burst proportion
2) Difference in spike-triggered power between burst and nonburst events
3) Difference in phase-locking between burst and nonburst events
4) Difference in phase-dependent power between burst and nonburst events
5) ...and much more!
